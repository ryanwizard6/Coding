                <p><strong>Why Camden?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Environmental Strategy:</strong>  He believes that we should not pass legislation yet for green house gas emmissions because the technology is not there yet and it takes more energy and green house gases to make ev cars and batteries than traditional gas cars.</strong> </li>
                    <li><strong>Business Strategy:</strong> Camden believes that we should support american businesses and offer tax cuts to small starter businesses and that we should raise taxes however raise the minimum wage every half census or 5 years to help combat the tax raise and we should improve efforts to help restore the american dream where people can buy a house and live off a single income.</li>
                    <li><strong>Global Relationships and Immigration: </strong>  He has a strong belief that we should encourage world peace and act as the officers of the world and use our power to our advantage in world peace however we should first focus on our safety over other countries. He thinks that we should also fund ICE and border patrol to help get rid of illegal immigrants but we should however encourage the legal process to come to the countryt and provide outreach to struggling countries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Domestic Policy:</strong> He believes that we should provide what the people ened by making legislation ban recreational drugs such as nicotine and smoking and that we should be providing education on guns to the people so we can be trained to handle one safely. </li>
                    <li><strong>Foreign Policy:</strong> He wants a foreign policy prioritizing national interests by balancing state interaction, economic tools, and military strength, while collaborating with Congress on treaties and funding, and addressing global issues like human rights, trade, and security challenges.</li>
